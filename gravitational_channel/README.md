### [arXiv:xxxx.xxxx](https://arxiv.org/abs/xxxx.xxxx)

### Abstract

### Notebooks
1. [analysis_of_experimental_requirements](https://github.com/andreamari/optomechanics/blob/master/gravitational_channel/analysis_of_experimental_requirements.ipynb)

### How to use
The code is written in Python and is organized in self-contained Jupyter notebooks.
It can be visualized on GitHub (without execution) by just clicking on its file name.

### Requirements
Jupyter Notebook should be [installed](https://jupyter.org/install) to execute the notebooks in your local machine.
