### [arXiv:xxxx.xxxx](https://arxiv.org/abs/xxxx.xxxx)

### Abstract

### Notebooks
1. [gravity_mediated_channel_full_solution](https://github.com/andreamari/optomechanics/blob/master/gravitational_channel/gravity_mediated_channel_full_solution.ipynb)
2. [analysis_of_experimental_requirements](https://github.com/andreamari/optomechanics/blob/master/gravitational_channel/analysis_of_experimental_requirements.ipynb)

### How to use
The code is written in Python and is organized in self-contained Jupyter notebooks.
It can be visualized on GitHub (without execution) by just clicking on its file name.

### Requirements
Jupyter Notebook should be [installed](https://jupyter.org/install) to execute the notebooks in your local machine. 
The following Python packages are also required `numpy`, `matplotlib`.
