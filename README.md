This repository contains code about optomechanical systems.

## Content

- An educational Python [notebook](optomechanics.ipynb) explaining and numerically reproducing the results of [T Westphal, H Hepach, J Pfaff, M Aspelmeyer, _Measurement of Gravitational Coupling between Millimeter-Sized Masses_, Nature, 591, 2021](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03250-7)  (free version  [arXiv:2009.09546](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.09546)). The aim of the notebook is reproducing the main results with the simplest possible code and explaining all the steps assuming a non-expert reader.
